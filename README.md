Module-Wise Breakdown 
Process Setup Panel 
• Allows users to define the number of processes and the resources 
required. 
• Provides options to set resource allocation and requests 
dynamically. 
IPC Simulation Panel 
• Users can select different IPC mechanisms: 
o Pipes – Unidirectional communication between processes. 
o Message Queues – Stores messages exchanged between 
processes. 
o Shared Memory – Processes access a common memory space. 
o Sockets – Enables communication between processes over a 
network. 
• Simulates data exchange between processes and displays 
communication flow. 
Process Display Panel 
• Shows the status of processes: 
o Active processes – Currently running IPC operations. 
o Queued processes – Awaiting resource allocation. 
o Completed processes – Successfully finished IPC tasks. 
Deadlock Detection & Debugging Panel 
• Identifies potential deadlocks using circular wait detection. 
• Provides real-time logs of detected deadlocks. 
• Suggests and applies deadlock resolution strategies automatically.
